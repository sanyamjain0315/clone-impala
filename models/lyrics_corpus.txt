someone said they left together
i ran out the door to get her
she was holding hands with trevor
not the greatest feeling ever
said, "pull yourself together
you should try your luck with heather"
then i heard they slept together
oh, the less i know the better
the less i know the better
oh, my love
can't you see yourself by my side?
no surprise
when you're on his shoulder like every night
oh, my love
can't you see that you're on my mind?
don't suppose you could
convince your lover to change his mind
so goodbye
she said, "it's not now or never
wait ten years, we'll be together"
i said, "better late than never
just don't make me wait forever"
don't make me wait forever
don't make me wait forever

oh, my love
can't you see yourself by my side?
i don't suppose you could
convince your lover to change his mind
i was doing fine without ya
till i saw your face, now i can't erase
givin' in to all his bullshit
is this what you want? is this who you are?
i was doing fine without ya
till i saw your eyes turn away from mine
oh, sweet darling, where he wants you
said, "come on, superman, say your stupid line"
said, "come on, superman, say your stupid line"
said, "come on, superman, say your stupid line"
i can just hear them now
"how could you let us down?"
but they don't know what i found
or see it from this way 'round
feeling it overtake
all that i used to hate
one by one, every trait
i tried, but it's way too late
all the signs i don't read
two sides of me can't agree
will i be in too deep?
going with what i always longed for
feel like a brand-new person
but you'll make the same old mistakes
well, i don't care, i'm in love
stop before it's too late
i know…
feel like a brand-new person
but you'll make the same old mistakes
i finally know what it's like
(you don't have what it takes)
stop before it's too late
i know there's too much at stake
making the same mistakes
and i still don't know why it's happening
stop while it's not too late
and i still don't know…
you might also like
finally taking flight
i know you don't think it's right
i know that you think it's fake
maybe fake's what i like
the point is, i have the right
not thinkin' in black and white
thinkin' it's worth the fight
soon i'll be out of sight
knowing it all this time
going with what i always longed for
feel like a brand-new person
but you'll make the same old mistakes
well, i don't care, i'm in love
stop before it's too late
feel like a brand-new person
but you'll make the same old mistakes
so how do i know i've gone too far?
(you don't have what it takes)
stop before it's too late
man, i know that it's hard to digest
but maybe your story ain't so different from the rest
and i know it seems wrong to accept
but you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
man, i know that it's hard to digest
a realization is as good as a guess
and i know it seems wrong to accept
but you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
but you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
feel like a brand-new person
so, how will i know that it's right?
in a new direction
so, how will i know i've gone too far?
stop thinking that the only option was…
feel like a brand-new person
i finally know what it's like
stop thinking that the only option was…
in a new direction
so how will i know i've gone too far?
stop thinking that the only option was…
and i know it's hard to describe
stop thinking that the only option was…
so how will i know that it's right?
it's always around me, all this noise
but not nearly as loud as the voice saying
"let it happen, let it happen (it's gonna feel so good)
just let it happen, let it happen"
all this running around trying to cover my shadow
a notion growing inside, now all the others seem shallow
all this running around bearing down on my shoulders
i can hear an alarm, must be morning
i heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round
it's gonna carry off all that isn't bound
and when it happens, when it happens (i won't be holding on)
so let it happen, let it happen
all this running around, i can't fight it much longer
something's trying to get out and it's never been closer
if my take-off fails, make up some other story
but if i never come back, tell my mother i'm sorry
i cannot vanish and you will not scare me
tryna get through it, try to bounce to it
you were not thinkin' that i will not do it
they be lovin' someone and i'm another story
take the next ticket to take the next train
why would i do it? and you wanna think that
i cannot vanish and you will not scare me
tryna get through it, try to bounce to it
you were not thinkin' that i will not do it
they be lovin' someone and i'm another story
take the next ticket to take the next train
why would i do it? anyone think that-
baby, now i'm ready, moving on
oh, but maybe i was ready all along
oh, i'm ready for the moment and the sound
oh, but maybe i was ready all along
oh baby, now i'm ready, moving on
oh, but maybe i was ready all along
oh, i'm ready for the moment and the sound
oh, but maybe i was ready all along, oh baby
i was raging, it was late
in the world my demons cultivate
i felt the strangest emotion but it wasn't hate for once
yes, i'm changing, yes, i'm gone
yes, i'm older, yes, i'm moving on
and if you don't think it's a crime, you can come along with me
life is moving, can't you see?
there's no future left for you and me
i was hoping and i was searching endlessly
but baby, now there's nothing left that
i can do
so don't be blue
there is another future waiting there for you
i saw it different, i must admit
i caught a glimpse, i'm going after it
they say people never change but that's bullshit, they do
yes, i'm changing, can't stop it now
and even if i wanted, i wouldn't know how
another version of myself i think i've found at last
and i can't always hide away
curse indulgence and despise the fame
there is a world out there and it's calling my name
and it's calling yours, girl, it's calling

arise and walk, come through

it feels like i only go backwards, baby
every part of me says, "go ahead"
i got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
feels like we only go backwards, darling
i know that you think you sound silly when you call my name
but i hear it inside my head all day
when i realise i'm just holding on to the hope that maybe
your feelings don't show
it feels like i only go backwards, baby
every part of me says, "go ahead"
i got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
feels like we only go backwards, darling
the seed of all this indecision isn't me, oh no
'cause i decided long ago
but that's the way it seems to go
when trying so hard to get to something real
it feels
it feels like i only go backwards, darling
every part of me says, "go ahead"
i got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
feels like we only go backwards, darling

i know i always said that i could never hurt you
well, this is the very, very last time i'm ever going to, ah
but i know that i'll be happier and i know you will too
said i know that i'll be happier and i know you will too
eventually, ah-ah-ah-ah
eventually, ah-ah-ah-ah
wish i could turn you back into a stranger

like the brutal morning sun
it dawns on me, what have i done?
saying sorry ain't as good as saying why
but it buys me a little more time
lost in the moment for the second time
each fuck up that i make, that makes you cry
i'm as pathetic, as the reason why
in desperation, all that you can do is ask me why
‘cause i'm a man, woman
don't always think before i do
‘cause i'm a man, woman
that's the only answer i got for you (uh)
‘cause i'm a man, woman
not often proud of what i choose
i'm a human, woman
a greater force i answer to
once again, as it takes a hold
i am aware, not in control
you see, i have a conscience and it's never fooled
but it's prone to be overruled
you wanna know why i always think i’m right?
(why?) you never accept defeat and let it slide
(why?) i have no voice if i don’t speak my mind
(why?) my weakness is the source of all my pride
i'll tell you why

ever since i was a small boy
no one else compared to you, no way
i always thought heroes stayed close
whenever troubled times arose
i didn't know
ain't always how it goes
every single word you told me
i believed without a question, always
to save all of us, you told us both to trust
but now i know you only saved yourself
did you think i'd never know?
never wise up as i grow?
and you could store an ocean in the holes
in any of the explanations that you gave
and while you still had time, you had a chance
but you decided to take all your sorrys to the grave

you didn't know that i suffered
what a thing to discover
if there was time to recover
one-on-one with each other
just a boy and a father
what i'd give for another
everything that i have
wouldn't need this for long
never speak of the time
that you left us alone
me and steve on our own
i wanna tell you 'bout the time
wanna tell you 'bout my life
wanna play you all my songs
learn the words, sing along
(this time) wanna tell you 'bout the time
(i know) i was in abbey road
or the time that i had
mick jagger on the phone
i thought of you when we spoke
wanna tell you 'bout the time
wanna tell you 'bout my life
wanna play you all my songs
hear your voice sing along
(this time) i wanna say, "it's all right"
(i know) you're just a man after all
and i know you had demons
i got some of my own
i think you passed them along
wanna tell you 'bout the time

when we were livin' in squalor, wasn't it heaven?
back when we used to get on it four out of seven
now even though that was a time i hated from day one
eventually, terrible memories turn into great ones
so if they call you, embrace them
if they hold you, erase them
'cause it might've been somethin', who's to say?
does it help to get lost in yesterday?
and you might've missed somethin', don't say
'cause it has to be lost in yesterday
and you're gonna have to let it go someday
you've been diggin' it up like groundhog day
'cause it might've been somethin', don't say
'cause it has to be lost in yesterday
matty said life didn't go the way that he planned it

replace it
i may not be as honest as i ought to be
now that, when the walls go up
i said it didn't worry me but it hit me like an arrow
babe, to know, i could just be paranoid
won't quell the desire to know what was really going on
"does it really fucking matter, babe?" is all you can ask me
okay, fair play, here we go
i've heard those words before
are you sure it was nothing
'cause it made me feel like dying inside
never thought i was insecure, but it's pure
didn't notice until i was in love for real
am i really gonna cross the line
just to find what you're typing?
if only i could read your mind
ooh, i'd be fine, i'd be normal
but now’s my time, gonna do it
and suddenly i'm the phony one
the only one with a problem
true love is bringing it out of me
the worst in me, and i know now
do you remember the time we were
the time we were by the ocean?
i didn't care if it was day or night
the world was right where i wanted
girl, i'm sorry
babe, i'm really, really sorry
in the end, it's stronger than i know how to be
and i can't just spend my whole lifetime wondering
i fell in love with the sound of my heels on the wooden floor
i don't want my footsteps to be silent anymore
want them to be in the moment
storm clouds are closing
in the end, it’s coming, there’s nothing left to do
but i'm still not certain, just how i'm gonna feel
i'll only know in the moment (ooh)

well, he feels like an elephant
shaking his big grey trunk for the hell of it
he knows that you're dreamin' about being loved by him
too bad your chances are slim
and it's not like mr. shuck
to get shy when they ask him who is on top
there must be something deep down in the dark down there
but he's not too easily scared
he's got friends but they got the fear
wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared
oh look, hey, there he is now coming down the stairs
(here he comes)
he pulled the mirrors off his cadillac (yeah)
'cause he doesn't like it looking like he looks back
he talks like his opinion is a simple fact
somebody grabbed his collar
he cried the whole way home
no one remembered a thing when they saw him again
that's how it is 'til the end (yeah)

i was picking up a suit from the dry cleaners
which is standard for me, thursday, 12:30
i've got a pretty solid routine these days
i don't know, it just works for me
anyway, i was leaving, i was getting in my car
and i went to adjust the rear-view mirror
but, in its reflection, just for a second
i saw a figure, started to trigger
memories flooded back, stopped me in my tracks
"who was that?" it was my lover
a lover from a past life
from a past life
feel like i saw a ghost
from a past life
so unexpected
from a past life
i was transfixed
from a past life
well, somewhere between a lover and a friend
it was different back then
surreal, poetic but uncertain
like a bizarre chick-flick with a confusing end
but i shut it down, closed it off
the sounds and smells i made myself forget
a cheap solution to black out regret
but it was real, it just feels like a past life
you might also like
from a past life
crazy
from a past life
it takes a lot to trip me out
(i always wondered if you wanted my love)
for the first time in a long time
(i always wondered if you wanted my love)
so i go about my day as normal
but i can't seem to pass it off as just a random event
it consumes me
i thought i was moving on, but i guess i was just switching off
and now i see my life as the banal slog it instantly became
and i don't know if i can go on the same
but i don't wanna dig up old bones
i mean, i don't even know if she has the same phone number
who knows? maybe she does
from a past life
i guess there's no harm in trying
from a past life
what's the worst that could happen?
(i always wondered if you wanted my love)
for the first time
in a long time
(i tried to say it but it never came out right)
past life
from a past life
(you're not a stranger if you're always on my mind)
for the first time
(i know it's late, it just didn't feel right)
in a long time
hello?
feels like my life is ready to blow
me and my love, we'll take it slow
i hope she knows that i'll love her long
i just don't know where the hell i belong (no, no)
how optimism led me astray
two hundred things i took the wrong way
but i saw her love gauge runnin' low
i tried to fill but it overflowed
feels like my life is ready to blow
me and my lover taking it slow
i hope she knows that i'll love her long
i just don't know where the hell i belong
she remembers my name
could be blown way out
it's all going to change
she remembers my name
but she was only messing around
please, no more playing with my heart
ooh, go mr. right just for once
(then it all just came out)
ooh, no more mischief with my mind
(guess i'll hold in, next time...)
you might also like
no more gettin' it wrong
i'll be frozen, here on
if forever, we'll see
no more guessin' for me
oh, i was just so sure of everything
oh, that's what you get for dreamin' aloud
(then it all just came out)
(guess i'll hold in, now on)
(if forever, we'll see)
oh, the day that words are clearer for me
(but no more guessing for me)
something doesn't feel right
that's enough for one night
hope y'all get home alright
there i go, blamin' on the weather
but hey, there's nothin' wrong
i'm only tired of all these voices
always sayin' nothing lasts forever
it might be time to face it
it ain't as fun as it used to be, no
you're goin' under
you ain't as young as you used to be
it might be time to face it
you ain't as cool as you used to be, no
you won't recover
you ain't as young as you used to be
it might be time to face it
it might be time to face it
i've been lost before
so tell me it's not over
'cause i finally got somethin' goin'
and suddenly
all my friends are growin' up
and movin' on
i must be missin' somethin'

it might be time
it might be time to face it (yeah)
you may as well embrace it
we promise to come visit (yeah)
it might be time
it might be time to face it (yeah)
you ain't as fun as you used to be
you won't recover
you ain't as cool as you used to be
it might be time to face it
it might be time to face it
we were hangin' in the morning
feelin' all different kinds of things
we were talkin' about everything
from the past to the happenin'
we started talkin' 'bout devotion
the kind that goes on eternally
and i tell her i'm in love with her
but how can i know that i'll always be?
she just said, "is it true? is it true? tell me now"
that's a promise i can't make and i won't validate
was i in some kind of mood? i don't know, i don't care
now i'm sleeping in my room, here i am, back again
she's in my
i was happy just listening
no intention to be mentioning
we started talkin' 'bout the future
not the notion i was motioning
i'm just so terrified to face up
like any moment i might wake up
'cause she's the only thing i think of
i told my mother that i love her

she just said, "is it true? is it true? tell me now"
that's a promise i can't make and i won't validate
was i being immature? i don't know, i don't care
now i'm sleeping in my room, here i am, back again
she's in my—
in my—
i said, "we'll see, we'll see" (in my—)
we'll see
ah, we'll see
we'll see
we'll see, we'll see, we'll see
see how we go
until we know what the future holds
ah, we'll see

we'll see, we'll see, we'll see
has it really been that long?
did i count the days wrong?
did we just go 'round and 'round
all the way to step one?
they would ask me all the time
every time the show's up
"so what you doin' with your life?"
it ain't givin' up
just growin' up in stages
(lay down, low down)
livin' life in phases
another season changes
and still, my days are shapeless
it's always drive straight, don't be late
'cause time waits for no one
i should be flying straight, with no delay
'cause time takes from everyone
i'm just laying here
waiting for a change to come
take us to the place
takin' us where we would have gone

it's always drive straight, don't be late
'cause time waits for no one
i should be flying straight, with no delay
'cause time takes from everyone
'cause i was nervous, sure
but it's something i'm used to
and i could tell by your face
no one's ever been rude to you
when i could tell you things
that i can't say to anyone
and you came home today
but you didn't stay very long
now it's like the world owes you
walking around like everybody should know you
i wanna be like we used to
but now you're worried whose audience will lose you
and i had no idea
what that feeling could do to you
and i could tell you've changed
by the people around you
i used to take the long way
just so i could walk past your door
i used to wait outside

just a moment
right before all the song and dance
wasn't brave enough to tell you
but there ain't gonna be another chance
it's not long until (all that i have)
and everything's still (one more hour)
minutes are racing, whatever i've done
i did it for love (all that i have)
i did it for fun (one more hour)
couldn't get enough (all that i have)
i did it for fame (one more hour)
but never for money
not for houses, not for her
not for my future children
until now
how could i love again?
how could i ever ask for more?
and to the road ahead
into a life i can't ignore
(lose her) how could i love again?
(move on) how can i walk this path for sure?
(lose her) with no more time to spare

just a minute, fella, right before you go out there
all your voices said you wouldn't last a minute bare
one more hour and you'll know your life is one to share
just a minute, baby, right before we go from here
all those people said we wouldn't last a minute near

this could be the day that we push through
it could be the day that all our dreams come true
for me and you
till we're at the end of just another day
are you too terrified to try your best?
just to end up with an educated guess
like success
like those times you wake up mystified
oh, it feels so real in my sleep
never held something so close i couldn't keep
into the day, the strangest feeling
do you really live without the fear that
everything is changing
and there's nothing i can do
my world is turning pages
while i am just sitting here
well, am i getting closer?
will i ever get there?
does it even matter?

nothing ever changes
no matter how long you do your hair
looks the same to everyone else
everything is changing
i guess i should warn my mum
but she'll just be excited
i close my front door and turn on the light
i let out a breath and hold in a sigh
ain't nothin' new, ain't that much in sight
and if i'm counting days, dream fruition ain't what it's looking like
but strictly speaking, i'm still on track
strictly speaking, i'm holding on
more than a minor setback
but strictly speaking, i'm still on track
and all of my dreams are still in sight
'cause strictly speaking, i've got my whole life
i lost a wheel a while back
but strictly speaking, i'm still on track
challenges falling in my lap
strung out again, but still on track
i know it's unrealistic, over-optimistic
i know i tried before this, i know it's nearly august
i know i can't ignore this, looking forward to all this
sayin', "babe, i just adore this" and, "babe, can we afford this?"
i know it's been a slow year, nothin' much to show here

i'm happy just to watch her move
and in all honesty, i don't have a hope in hell

do you remember we were standing here a year ago?
our minds were racing and time went slow
if there was trouble in the world, we didn't know
if we had a care, it didn't show
but now i worry our horizons bear nothing new
'cause i get this feeling and maybe you get it too
we're on a rollercoaster stuck on its loop-de-loop
'cause what we did one day on a whim
has slowly become all we do
i never wanted any other way to spend our lives
i know we promised we'd be doing this 'til we die
and now i fear we might
ooh, now i fear we might
but it's okay
i think there's a way
why don't we just say, "one more year"? (one more year)

not carin' if we do the same thing every week (one more year)

there's no use trying to relate to that older soul
and no use trying to debate that they've got it wrong
there's no use pining for love when you're on your own
and no use crying outside if nobody's home
there's no use flying to the moon if they won't believe
so why do i go wrong on repeat?
i was blinded by a memory
like it's someone else, like it wasn't me
and there's every chance i'll be learning fast
and the day will come and then it will pass
what do you want when i say i won't?
and though i try, i do the same, as though i must
and in the air of today is tomorrow's dust
there's no use trying to relate to that older soul

in the morning you'll find
real life was such a grind
off i go, day is done
where a new one's just begun
nothing that has happened so far has been anything we could control
i am just here waiting for the perfect time to tell you i don't know
maybe i'm just reading into it a little deeper than i should
we would make it easy, we would take it slowly, if only we could
hey, what are you doing out here? you're thinking about everything, aren't you? i know it’s crazy, just don't think of it like that. nothing has to mean anything. come on, come back inside
elodie, look at me, unless you're tryin' to hurt me
heavy blow, down i go, now i just want to let go
is it right? is it wrong? i don't know
it's not the cause i'm fightin' for anymore, but it sucks to keep on runnin'
eventually, there will be a time for clearer thinking
for now, i weep, can't get to sleep, i try to hold a good feeling
i just get one, here it comes, there it goes
now we just might lose the fight, yeah, but it's alright, it wasn't our decision
nothing that has happened so far has been anything we could control
i am just here waiting for the perfect time to tell you that i know
every man is happy until happiness is suddenly a goal
i'll just be here waiting 'til the doctor calls and then i'll let you know
cracks in the pavement underneath my shoe
i care less and less about it and less about you
no one else around to look at me so
i can look at my shadow as much as i please
all the kicks that i can't compare to
making friends like you're all supposed to
oh, you will never come close to how i feel
you will never come close to how i feel
space around me where my soul can breathe
off-guard body that my mind can leave

i had forgiven you
for tricking me again
but i have been tricked again
into forgiving you
what is this?
are you some kind of hypnotist?
waving your powers around
the sun eclipse behind the cloud

amongst all of those strangers
but i am the stranger now
amongst all of the recognized

waving your powers around

she keeps wishing for the secret society to fall
she keeps watching for the jaguar
with a silver trembling hand
dagger

tomorrow
she forgets about the fear
when she's high
when she's high
when she's high
when she's high
she puts diamonds on her forehead
they remind her how the animals and trees and insects call
is it wrong not to believe
nature makes us all complete
daggers

so deep into the jungle we go
on your journey to the middle of nowhere
feeling your loss comes right on cue
so are you waiting for insanity
or is it sanity waiting for you?
i bet you're not that happy
now it's run right out on you
i said hey, i gotta follow you girl
so into the jungle we go, oh yeah
i got evil in my veins, just to cause you pain

you just smile, i will be right
and if i'm wrong
then i'm testing you

but at least now i know
it wasn't love, it wasn't love
it must have been an illusion
mistaken for love, it wasn't love
it must have been a confusion
my guessing game is strong
now that i know what's on

i've never known a girl like you before
now, just like in a song from days of yore
'cause here you come a-knocking, knocking on my door
and i've never met a girl like you before
give me just a taste so i want more
now my hands are bleeding and my knees are raw
'cause now you got me crawling, crawling on the floor
and i've never known a girl like you before
you made me acknowledge the devil in me
i hope to god i'm talking metaphorically
hope that i'm talking allegorically
know that i'm talking 'bout the way i feel
and i've never known a girl like you before
never, never, never, never
never known a girl like you before

well, he feels like an elephant
shakin' his big grey trunk for the hell of it
he knows that you're dreaming about
being loved by him
too bad your chances are slim
and it’s not like mister shook to get shy
when they ask him who is on top
there must be something deep down
in the dark down there
he’s not too easily scared
he’s got friends but they got the fear
wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared
oh look, hey, there he is now
coming down the stairs
(here he comes)
he pulled the mirrors off his cadillac
‘cause he doesn’t like it looking
like he looks back
he talks like his opinion is a simple fact
somebody grabbed his collar
he cried the whole way home
no one remembered a thing
when they saw him again
that’s how it is 'til the end (yeah)
why won't you make up your mind?
give me a sign
why won't you make up your mind?
give me a sign
am i wasting my time living in my head?
you'll be sorry when i make up mine instead
why won't you make up your mind?
give me a sign
why won't you make up your mind?
give me a sign
am i wasting my time living in my head?
you'll be sorry when i make up mine instead

sanki sadece gidiyorum geriye, bebeğim
her parçam diyor ki, "devam et"
umutlandım yine, oh yo, yine olmaz
sanki sadece gidiyoruz geriye, güzelim
bana adımla seslendiğinde saçma geliyor biliyorum
ama tüm gün kafamın içinde duyuyorum
sonra da fark ediyorum ki tek umduğum şey
hislerini belli etmemen
sanki sadece gidiyorum geriye, bebeğim
her parçam diyor ki, "devam et"
umutlandım yine, oh yo, yine olmaz
sanki sadece gidiyoruz geriye, güzelim
tüm bu kararsızlığın kaynağı ben değilim, oh yo
çünkü ben kararımı verdim
ama böyle oluyor sanırım
gerçek bir şeye ulaşmak için ne çok uğraştık
sanki
sanki sadece gidiyorum geriye, güzelim
her parçam diyor ki, "devam et"
umutlandım yine, oh yo, yine olmaz
sanki sadece gidiyoruz geriye, güzelim
sanki sadece gidiyorum geriye, bebeğim

the future is a mystery
i wonder what we'll see
when we get to

"don't you know it doesn't have to be so hard?
waiting for everyone else around to agree
might take too long
might take too long"
"when it won't be so hard" (it won't be so hard)
well, it's true, yes, but you won't get far telling me
that you're all you're meant to be
when the one from my dream
is sitting right next to me
and i don't know what to do
oh, alter ego
get them to love you
while they may, depending on your words and wealth
the only onе who's really judging you is yourself
nobody elsе, nobody else

oh, alter ego
but don't remind me of home
there's everywhere i'd rather go
it's true that some things have to change, oh no

or i might notice where i am
it's true that some things have to change
i know some things have to change
it's true that some things have to change
i know some things have to change, oh no

as i ascend into the sky
but i'm the one who's left behind

therе is nothing that is safe
i know some things have to change, oh
yeah, i do
yeah, i do
but don't remind me of home
in case it isn't quite the same
